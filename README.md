# cbm_2024

My annual dev portfolio build ðŸ«¡

Currently in development ðŸš§

Using twv4 which is not tested in the way I am using it.

Using a custom highlighter I wrote locally with swc/cli for the highlighter. I ommitted that for now. It's a modified version of [sugar-high](https://sugar-high.vercel.app/) that I plan on building upon.

You can use sugar-high as a replacement for the highlighter.

This is the first commit, use only as a starting point! Do not use in production.

Fixes, features, and updates to come ðŸš€

Special thanks to [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com)
