# cbm_2024

My annual dev portfolio build ðŸ«¡

Currently in development ðŸš§

Using twv4 which is not tested in the way I am using it. Just experimenting with it for now.

# Current folder structure for Twv4

Here is the current folder structure I use to make things work. This is subject to change as I am actively experimenting with this setup, the cascade layers, configurations, and the design system overall. 

```
root(
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes          -- Routes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css     -- Dynamically injected and minified css, via build script.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx        -- Home page.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.[ts|x]        -- Any next config files/components/middleware/etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ components          -- Components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **/*.[tsx]      -- Any and all components.
â”œâ”€â”€ styles              -- All css files included here is compiled into globals.css. (For now)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base.css        -- Viewing v4 source code, I am experimenting with modularizing the css into different layers.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hl.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.css       -- Main css file, where all css files are imported and layered.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme.css       -- Light/Dark theme variables.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ typography.css  -- Custom typography based on traditional prose, as well as shadcn. Still needs work alongside Mdx components.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utilities.css   -- Utility classes. One line import rule.
â”œâ”€â”€ lib                 -- Custom scripts and utilities   
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugins         -- Highlighter re written originally by sugar high.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fonts           -- Variable fonts.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.[ts|x]        -- Any custom scripts or utilities.    
â””â”€â”€ package.json        -- pnpm package.json. Build scripts, overrides, and dependencies testing react, next, and twv4 combinations.
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json       -- Typescript configuration.
â””â”€â”€ postcss.config.js   -- Postcss configuration.
â””â”€â”€ pnpm-lock.yaml      -- pnpm lock file.
â””â”€â”€ *.[ts]              -- Other files.
)
```

Using a custom highlighter I wrote locally with swc/cli for the highlighter. I omitted that for now. It's a modified version of [sugar-high](https://sugar-high.vercel.app/) that I plan on building upon.

You can use sugar-high highlight function directly as a replacement for the highlighter. Follow the documentation for styling.

Use only as a starting point! Do not use in production.

Fixes, features, and updates to come ðŸš€
