# cbm_2024

My annual dev portfolio build currently in development ðŸš§

Next.js, TailwindV4, and experiments. Do not use for production in it's current state.

# Current folder structure for Twv4

Here is the current folder structure I use to make things work. (Not every file.) This is subject to change as I am actively experimenting with this setup, the cascade layers, configurations, and the design system overall. 

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes          -- Routes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css     -- Dynamically injected and minified css, via build script.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx        -- Home page.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.[ts|x]        -- Any next config files/components/middleware/etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ components          -- Components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **/*.[tsx]      -- Any and all components.
â”œâ”€â”€ styles              -- All css files included here is compiled into globals.css. (For now)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base.css        -- Viewing v4 source code, I am experimenting with modularizing the css into different layers.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hl.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.css       -- Main css file, where all css files are imported and layered.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme.css       -- Light/Dark theme variables.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ typography.css  -- Custom typography based on traditional prose, as well as shadcn. Still needs work alongside Mdx components.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utilities.css   -- Utility classes. One line import rule.
â”œâ”€â”€ lib                 -- Custom scripts and utilities
